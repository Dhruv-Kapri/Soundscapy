    "# `Soundscapy` - Quick Start Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "By Andrew Mitchell, Research Fellow, University College London\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "`Soundscapy` is a python toolbox for analysing quantitative soundscape data. Urban soundscapes are typically assessed through surveys which ask respondents how they perceive the given soundscape. Particularly when collected following the technical specification ISO 12913, these surveys can constitute quantitative data about the soundscape perception. As proposed in *How to analyse and represent quantitative soundscape data* [(Mitchell, Aletta, & Kang, 2022)](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1121/10.0009794), in order to describe the soundscape perception of a group or of a location, we should consider the distribution of responses. `Soundscapy`'s approach to soundscape analysis follows this approach and makes it simple to process soundscape data and visualise the distribution of responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on the theory underlying the assessments and forms of data collection, please see ISO 12913-Part 2, *The SSID Protocol* [(Mitchell, *et al.*, 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/7/2397), and *How to analyse and represent quantitative soundscape data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to give a brief overview of how `Soundscapy` works and how to quickly get started using it to analyse your own soundscape data. The example dataset used is *The International Soundscape Database (ISD)* (Mitchell, *et al.*, 2021), which is publicly available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6331810) and is free to use. `Soundscapy` expects data to follow the format used in the ISD, but can be adapted for similar datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "`Soundscapy` is currently under active development. To install with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install soundscapy\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Data included\n",
    "\n",
    "The ISD contains two primary types of data - surveys and acoustic metrics. The surveys include several blocks of questions, the most important of which are the Perceptual Attribute Questions (PAQS). These form the 8 descriptors of the soundscape circumplex - pleasant, vibrant, eventful, chaotic, annoying, monotonous, uneventful, and calm. In addition, each survey includes other information about the soundscape and demographic characteristics (age, gender, etc.). Finally, the survey section includes identifiers of when and where the survey was conducted - the LocationID, SessionID, latitude, longitude, start_time, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final bit of information for the survey is the `GroupID`. When stopping respondents in the survey space, they were often stopped as a group, for instance a couple walking through the space would be approached together and given the same `GroupID`. While each group completes the survey, a binaural audio recording is taken, typically lasting about 30 seconds. It is from these recordings that the acoustic data is calculated. Therefore, each `GroupID` can be connected to something like 1 to 10 surveys, and to one recording, or one set of acoustic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the acoustic data are a set of psychoacoustic analyses calculated for each recording. For each metric, originally one value is calculated for each channel (right and left ear), and the maximum of the to channels is what is shown here.\n"

However, it is possible to use data which, although structured the same way, has a different range of values. For instance this could be a 7-point Likert scale, or a 0 to 100 scale. By passing these numbers both to `validate_dataset()` and `add_paq_coords()` as the `val_range`, `Soundscapy` will check that the data conforms to what is expected and will automatically scale the ISOCoordinates from -1 to +1 depending on the original value range. \n",
