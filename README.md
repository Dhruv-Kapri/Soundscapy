# Soundscapy

Your friendly little soundscape helper.

## Installation

For this under-development version, I suggest installing from source in the following way. 

Create a suitable conda environment by downloading just the environment.yml file:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate soundscapy-dev
```
Then, install soundscapy from the github source:
```
pip install git+git://github.com/MitchellAcoustics/Soundscapy@main
```
