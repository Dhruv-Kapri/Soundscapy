## Branches
All of the initial research code was written using functions. I'm planning to convert it to object-oriented programming to massively simplify it. In order to make something available right now, the `functional` branch: 
1. is based on (way too many) functions
2. should actually work (heh, functional)

As of writing (2021-01-21), you should only use the `functional` branch.
